# AWS-Three-Tier-Architecture-Project
# 📌 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the deployment of a scalable, secure, and highly available 3-tier web application on AWS. The 3-tier architecture separates the application into three layers:

1️⃣ Presentation Layer – Handles user requests (Frontend Web Servers)

2️⃣ Application Layer – Processes business logic (Backend EC2 Instances)

3️⃣ Data Layer – Manages storage & databases (Amazon RDS)

This architecture is commonly used by real-world applications such as e-commerce platforms, enterprise applications, and SaaS solutions.

✅ A scalable web application accessible via ALB URL.

✅ A private RDS database securely storing application data.

✅ Monitoring & logging enabled for performance tracking.
