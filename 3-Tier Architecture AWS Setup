Step 1: Create Two S3 Buckets

S3 Bucket 1: Store web-server & app-server code.

Upload the necessary code files from the local system.

S3 Bucket 2: Store VPC flow logs.

Step 2: Create IAM Role with Policies

Attach the following policies to a new IAM role:

S3 Read Only Access.

SSM Managed Instance Core (for EC2 management).

Step 3: Create VPC, Subnets, IGW, NAT-GW, RT

VPC Setup:

Create a custom VPC.

Add public and private subnets (Web, App, and DB tiers).

Internet Gateway (IGW) & NAT Gateway (NAT-GW):

Attach IGW to public subnets.

Configure NAT-GW for private subnets.

Route Tables (RT):

Associate appropriate routes for public and private subnets.

Enable Auto-assign Public IP for Web-tier public subnets.

Enable VPC Flow Logs and send logs to the S3 bucket.

Step 4: Create Security Groups

External Load Balancer SG → Allow HTTP (80) from 0.0.0.0/0.

Web-Tier SG → Allow HTTP (80) from External LB SG.

Internal Load Balancer SG → Allow HTTP (80) from Web-Tier SG.

App-Tier SG → Allow Port 4000 from Internal LB SG.

DB-Tier SG → Allow MySQL (3306) from App-Tier SG.

Step 5: Create DB Subnet Group & RDS

DB Subnet Group: Select private subnets.

RDS Setup:

Deploy a Multi-AZ RDS instance.

Associate it with the DB subnet group.

Step 6: Create Test App Server, Install Packages, Test Connections

Setup App Server:

Launch an EC2 instance and install dependencies.

Test connectivity to the DB.

Create AMI from App Server.

Create Launch Template using AMI.

Target Group & Internal Load Balancer:

Create a target group.

Deploy an internal load balancer.

Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

Configure Nginx:

Edit nginx.conf locally to add Internal-LB-DNS.

Upload modified file to S3.

Step 7: Create Test Web Server, Install Packages, Test Connections

Setup Web Server:

Install Nginx, Node.js (React) & dependencies.

Test connectivity to the App Server.

Create AMI from Web Server.

Create Launch Template using AMI.

Target Group & External Load Balancer:

Create a target group.

Deploy an external load balancer.

Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

Step 8: Add External ALB DNS Record in Route 53

Map the External ALB DNS to a custom domain using Route 53.

Step 9: Create CloudWatch Alarms Along with SNS

Set up alarms for critical metrics (CPU, memory, instance failures).

Configure SNS for notifications.

Step 10: Create CloudTrail

Enable CloudTrail to monitor AWS API activities.

Store logs in an S3 bucket.

Step 12: Deleting the Entir
